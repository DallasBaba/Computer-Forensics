# Penetration Testing Report

**Date:** 10/19/2024  
**Prepared by:** Babatunde Dallas  
**Client:** Robocat Industries  
**Suspect:** Alyssa P. Hacker  
**Incident:** Possible data exfiltration from Robocat Industries  

## Tools Used
- **WinRAR:** For ZIP file extraction and analysis.
- **Wireshark:** For packet capture analysis.
- **CyberChef:** For decoding and extracting data from encoded network payloads.

## Goals and Findings

1. **Can you discover what she was doing?**  
   The suspect logged in on Tue, 05 Apr 2022 06:57:46 GMT from the IP host `10.0.1.99:8989` using the Mozilla Firefox browser. She accessed multiple pages, including `/canonical.html` and `/success.txt?ipv4`.

2. **Any chance that you can find evidence of it and what she might have taken from our servers?**  
   The suspect requested and downloaded a file named `CATastrophic-initial-design-ideas.zip` using HTTP 1.1.  
   - **catzilla.jpeg** (550 KB) - Created on 04/05/2022 at 2:13 AM  
   - **mech.jpeg** (60.0 KB) - Created on 04/05/2022 at 2:10 AM  

3. **How did she even do it?**  
   The suspect logged in using the following credentials:  
   - **Username:** alyssa1337  
   - **Password:** correcthorsebatterystaple  

   She downloaded a file named `CATastrophic-initial-design-ideas.zip` (624 KB) from the server (IP: 172.16.204.133) via a VMware machine (IP: 10.0.1.99). The file was successfully transferred to a destination IP `85.221.77.19`.

4. **Can you discover if she sent the data somewhere to a third party?**  
   There is no evidence that the suspect sent the file to someone else over the internet.

## Report Details

The investigation began by extracting a `.pcap` file and analyzing it in Wireshark. I searched for GET/POST requests using `http.request.method == POST` and `http.request.method == GET` to locate any file transfers. The suspect used the host IP `10.0.1.99:8989` to get the file `CATastrophic-initial-design-ideas.zip`.

Upon confirming the GET request, I exported HTTP objects from Wireshark and sorted them by size. The file `CATastrophic-initial-design-ideas.zip` was the largest (624 KB). After downloading the file, I extracted it and found images (Appendix 1).

By following the TCP Stream, I discovered the suspect used Mozilla Firefox to download the file. The authorization used for the download was encoded, but I decoded it with CyberChef, revealing the suspectâ€™s login credentials. The timestamps from the TCP Stream confirmed the activity took place on Tue, 05 Apr 2022 06:57:46 GMT (Appendix 2 and 3).

I also analyzed possible data exfiltration using `http.response.code == 200`, confirming that the file was successfully transferred. I filtered the TCP stream for `tcp.stream eq 247` to trace the file request (Appendix 5).

Finally, I filtered POST requests to check for any file uploads but found no evidence of further exfiltration attempts (Appendix 6 & 7).
